Bleak is an acronym for Bluetooth Low Energy platform Agnostic Klient.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://bleak.readthedocs.io.

Bleak is a GATT client software, capable of connecting to BLE devices
acting as GATT servers. It is designed to provide a asynchronous,
cross-platform Python API to connect and communicate with e.g. sensors.

**Be warned: Bleak is still in an early state of implementation.**

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install bleak

If you are using the latest Github package in `server` branch, that includes the BleakServer, please use

```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pip install .
```

try to import the bleak server, if you are having issues install the missing dependencies.

Features
--------

* Supports Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) or greater
* Supports Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43
* Plans on macOS support via Core Bluetooth API (see `develop` branch for progress)


Addtional Features (only available if you install using this repository in the `server` branch)

* BleakServer (macOS and Windows)
* see example (examples/server_json.py)

Bleak supports reading, writing and getting notifications from
GATT servers, as well as a function for discovering BLE devices.

Usage
-----

To discover Bluetooth devices that can be connected to:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from bleak import discover

    async def run():
        devices = await discover()
        for d in devices:
            print(d)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(run())


Connect to a Bluetooth device and read its model number:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    from bleak import BleakClient

    address = "24:71:89:cc:09:05"
    MODEL_NBR_UUID = "00002a24-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"

    async def run(address, loop):
        async with BleakClient(address, loop=loop) as client:
            model_number = await client.read_gatt_char(MODEL_NBR_UUID)
            print("Model Number: {0}".format("".join(map(chr, model_number))))

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(run(address, loop))
